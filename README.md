# NETFLIX-_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS_CLUSTRING



The business use case for this Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering project is to improve content curation and provide personalized recommendations to Netflix users. By clustering the content based on various attributes such as genres, ratings, release years, and user viewing history, Netflix can create distinct categories of content. This approach allows Netflix to better understand user preferences and interests, ultimately leading to the delivery of more relevant and engaging content recommendations to each user.

This project aims to analyze Netflix's movie and TV show catalog, cluster the content using attributes like cast, country, genre, director, rating, and description, and create a content-based recommender system. By grouping similar content, Netflix seeks to improve user experience and reduce churn among its vast subscriber base of over 220 million users. The dataset consists of approximately 7787 records and 11 attributes.

 The code is implemented in Python and covers data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and model evaluation. Below is a breakdown of each phase: 
 
# 1.Data Preparation:
   
   source of data - dataset has been provided by alma-better.

   challenges we faced in the dataset is that the data is provided in the Unicode form and we have to decode it first for that we used the Unicode_escape encoding technique to read the 
   data from CSV.

    This phase involves collecting and preprocessing the data required for clustering. It includes steps such as data collection from Netflix's library, cleaning the data by handling 
    missing values or duplicates, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis. 

# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   
   EDA is conducted to gain insights into the dataset and understand the underlying patterns and characteristics of the movies and TV shows. It involves descriptive statistics, data 
   visualization, and exploring relationships between different attributes such as ratings, genres, and release years. EDA helps in identifying potential features for clustering and 
   understanding the distribution of data.
 
# 3. Model Selection: -
   
    Two clustering algorithms, K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering, are employed to create distinct clusters. The attributes are tokenized and vectorized using the TFIDF 
    vectorizer. To address dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. The optimal number of clusters is determined using methods like the elbow method, silhouette 
    score, and dendrogram.
 
# 4. Model Evaluation: -

  The selected clustering model is evaluated to assess its performance and effectiveness. Evaluation metrics such as silhouette score, within-cluster sum of squares, or visual inspection 
  of the resulting clusters can be used. The evaluation helps determine the quality of the clusters and their ability to capture similarities and patterns in the data. By leveraging data 
  preparation, EDA, model selection, and evaluation, Netflix aims to provide users with personalized recommendations based on their preferences and viewing history. This data-driven 
  approach enhances user engagement, satisfaction, and retention. Additionally, clustering enables Netflix to make data-informed decisions about content production and licensing, 
  optimizing their content library to meet user expectations. The code provided in this project serves as a foundation for implementing Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering, and it can 
  be further customized and expanded to meet specific requirements and objectives. Please refer to the documentation and code for detailed instructions on how to use and adapt the project 
  for your own needs.
